    /**
     * Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher,
     * write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

     According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of
     his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no
     more than h citations each."

     For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher has 5 papers
     in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. Since the
     researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more
     than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.

     Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
     * @param citations
     * @return
