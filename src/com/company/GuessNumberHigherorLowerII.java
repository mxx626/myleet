     * We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

     I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

     Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower.

     However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong,
     you pay $x. You win the game when you guess the number I picked.

     Example:

     n = 10, I pick 8.

     First round:  You guess 5, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $5.
     Second round: You guess 7, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $7.
     Third round:  You guess 9, I tell you that it's lower. You pay $9.

     Game over. 8 is the number I picked.

     You end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21.
     Given a particular n â‰¥ 1, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a win.
     * @param n
     * @return
